# Prework for the Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Workshop

## 1. Install Docker on your laptop

Visit [docker.com](http://docker.com) to download and install Docker on your laptop. If you'd like to learn more about Docker, see Docker's [getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/learn/).

## 2. Download the container image

Once you have installed Docker: open a terminal and download the workshop image using this command.

    $ docker pull kempy/tlwtf

## 3. Start the container

Start the Docker container with the following command.

    $ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 kempy/tlwtf

Open the link that looks like `http://localhost:8888/?token=<TOKEN>` in your browser

## 4. Complete the pre-work notebook

From the main page in your browswer, open the **1_hello_tensorflow.ipynb** notebook. Ensure you can run all the cells in notebook. If you have more time and you'd like to learn more about TensorFlow, you can also complete the **2_getting_started.ipynb** notebook.

Once you can load the pre-work notebooks, you're good to go for the workshop!
